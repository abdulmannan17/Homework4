                <p>Over the coming days and weeks many of you, along with your parents, will make one of the biggest decisions you’ve had to make so far – choosing a program that will best prepare you for the next several stages of your life.  This means not just university, but for life well beyond that. <br><br>

 

                    Applying to an A Level school can seem like a confusing process, but it doesn’t have to be complete guesswork. Karachi offers many strong A Level programs – each with its own culture, norms and strengths. With so many choices, you will need to research what is out there and how the options match your interests and needs. <br><br>
                    
                     
                    
                    As you browse through this website, you will come across many resources to help you with your research. As you study the program and policies, read/watch the messages from the Dean and go through the student testimonials, you will get a good sense of the culture, norms and strengths of the Nixor Community and our expectations from prospective students. <br><br>
                    
                     
                    
                    There are several ways you can learn more about Nixor in person. You are welcome to visit and meet our students, join us for a campus tour or sign-up for an information session if it helps you make an informed decision.

                <p>A Levels is arguably one of the most crucial periods of development towards the person you are striving to become.  Strong extracurricular involvement will not make up for a weak academic track record.  But an existence defined only by academic achievement will leave gaps in your own development in addition to falling short on your obligations to the larger community.<br><br>

 

                    The good news is that Karachi offers many strong A Level programs.  The tough part is to pick one that is aligned with your goals and objectives.  Thorough research is essential.  First off, give a lot of thought to understanding exactly what you want.   Be honest with yourself about what is important to you and then figure out the best place to get that.  You can find out about any A Level institution by talking to alums of your O Level school who are currently enrolled in that A Level program – what do they like and dislike about their experience.  Calling the office of Undergraduate Admissions at Universities of your choice can help you figure out what it is that universities look for in candidates.<br><br>
                    
                    ​
                    
                    There are many ways to find out if Nixor is the right fit for you.  Talk to Nixor students and alums.  Email Nixor students, alums and administrators.  Scour the website.   Understand the salient policies.  Know the vision, mission and core values of the Nixor Community.  Attend information sessions.  Visit the campus.  Attend the events during ILAN.  For questions that your parents might have, bring them to ILAN or have them attend the seminar for Parents of Prospective Students in January, 2015. But remember, life is not only about what you can get.  It is also about what you are prepared to give.  Try to figure out who can benefit from your skills –how you can make a contribution.<br><br>
                    
                     
                    
                    Nixor is certainly not the right answer for every student.  The bottomline is that the right choice for A Levels is about the right fit. Regardless of the A Level institution, make a commitment only after you are fully convinced about your choice.  Remember, schools need good students as much as you need good schools.  Don’t make hasty decisions.  Be discriminating in your choice and diligent in your research.  I will plan to do the same to ensure the members we choose to add to this community will help it reach its goals.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    
                    I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming weeks and months.<br><br>
                    
                     
                    
                    Good luck.<br><br>

            <p>As a family, selecting the right A Level institution for your son or daughter is a decision that will have implications beyond the two years of the A Level program.   Students at this age are transitioning from having most decisions made for them to making most decisions themselves.   How far you are along this spectrum will vary from family to family.  Personally, the only thing I would discourage is being at either end of that spectrum.<br><br>

 

                ​Ultimately the right A Level school is about finding the perfect fit between your objectives and expectations as a family and the program and approach of the A Level school.  Elements like the institution’s culture, norms and core values should be the foundation of the decision making process.  The strength of the program, the ability to create opportunities, provide resources and guidance as well as the financial implications would also figure significantly in the decision making process. ​Speaking as a parent, there are many questions that I would want answers to before making this decision.  “……because all my friends are going there”, is a response I would deem unsatisfactory.<br><br>
                
                 
                
                ​While the student would (and should) do much of this research, the guidance provided by your questions and the maturity of an adult’s thought process will be of benefit to your teenager.  But you don’t have to rely solely on their data.  Resources available to you as parents are numerous.  The links on this website should provide answers to many of your questions.  While answers to questions like, what is the policy on tuitions or on offering financial assistance can easily be gathered from the website, some questions are more about opinions.  For example, how conservative is the Nixor culture? How is discipline enforced? Does Nixor strictly enforce its policies? The answers to these questions would best come from talking to those, students or parents, teachers or administrators who have been immersed in this program, rather than on rumor and hearsay.<br><br>

                As a starting point, a one-page factsheet and a more detailed brochure can be downloaded from the website.  To address your questions about Nixor’s A Level program directly to me, you are welcome to attend the Prospective Parents Orientation seminar scheduled for January, 2015.  Please contact us at 0300 0778804 to RSVP.  During this seminar, we will discuss the academic program and achievement, university placement, extracurricular activities, the Nixor community culture and norms, discipline, ways parents can stay informed, financial awards, and salient policies.  We will reserve plenty of time for the question and answer session.<br><br>
